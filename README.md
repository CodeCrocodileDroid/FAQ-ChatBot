# FAQ-ChatBot
Python Chatbot

🤖 Python FAQ Chatbot - Rule-Based AI Assistant
A rule-based chatbot built with Python that answers frequently asked questions about Python programming using regex pattern matching.

✨ Features
🔍 Rule-Based Pattern Matching: Uses regex patterns to match user queries

📚 Comprehensive Python FAQ: Covers variables, functions, classes, loops, and more

🔄 Multiple Response Variations: Prevents repetitive answers with randomized responses

💬 Interactive Chat Interface: User-friendly command-line conversation

🎯 Graceful Error Handling: Proper handling of unknown queries

⚡ Extensible Architecture: Easy to customize for different topics

📋 Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)

Pattern Matching Process
Input Normalization: Convert to lowercase, strip whitespace

Regex Matching: Match against predefined patterns

Response Selection: Retrieve corresponding FAQ answer

Randomization: Select from multiple response variations

Output: Return formatted response

📚 FAQ About the FAQ Bot
Q: Can this bot learn new questions automatically?
A: No, it's rule-based. You need to manually add patterns and responses.

Q: How accurate is the pattern matching?
A: High accuracy for exact/similar phrasing, but may struggle with completely new phrasings.

Q: Can I use this for other topics besides Python?
A: Yes! The architecture is generic. Just replace the patterns and responses.

Q: Is there a web version?
A: Not yet, but you can easily wrap it with Flask/FastAPI.
